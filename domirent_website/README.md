## My first project for client.

1. It's a simple static website made in GatsbyJS framework. It was made for Domirent - small tools and stuff rental company from Poland.
2. I made this website fully on my own. I worked on the design with a client (he wanted a realy simple website to show comapny's offer) to get final layout accepted. Colours were picked to match leaflets that company distributes in its marketing teritory). 
3. RWD - the website is responsive on mobile devices, tablets, laptops and large screens.
4. I found a domain for client and connected it on my hosting page and deployed website on that hosting.
5. Even though it is not state of the art, but as my first one I'm realy proud of it.
