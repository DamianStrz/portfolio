## Default dynamic blog aoo made in NextJS and with Contentful.

1. It's a simple blog page made to train NextJS framework.
2. The design, styling and RWD are planned as next step in process of building sample app, as for now I was focused on functionalities.
3. This project is based on [The Net Ninja Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja) and it's a result of learning React and NextJS on my own to develop frontend skills.
