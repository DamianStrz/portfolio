## Default static blog app made in NextJS and markdown.

1. It's a simple blog page made to train NextJS framework and Markdown.
2. The design, styling and RWD are planned as next step in process of building sample app, as for now I was focused on functionalities.
3. This project is based on [Traversy Media Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) and it's a result of learning React and NextJS on my own to develop frontend skills and get some knowledge about frameworks.
