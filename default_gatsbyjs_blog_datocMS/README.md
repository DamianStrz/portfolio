## Default static blog app made in GatsbyJS and with DatoCMS.

1. It's a simple static blog page made to train GatsbyJS framework.
2. The design, styling and RWD are planned as next step in process of building sample app, as for now I was focused on functionalities. 
3. Further steps will be: finishing About us Page (content, styling), Gallery Page (content - some interesting form of pictures presentationm, styling), Contact Page (contact info or maybe contact form).
4. This project is based on paid course Gatsby.js made by [Hello Roman](https://www.youtube.com/@helloroman). I took this course to develop my frontend skills and get some knowledge about diffrent React frameworks.
5. Design of the project is a template from the course.
